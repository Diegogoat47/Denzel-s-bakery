      <h2>Baking Journey</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph"> 
    <p>“Denzel discovered his love for baking at the tender age of 10 when he baked his first batch of chocolate chip cookies with his grandmother. The joy of creating something delicious from scratch enthralled him. Over the years, he honed his skills by experimenting with various recipes and even creating some of his own. His dream is to share the joy of baking with others and inspire them to create their own baked wonders.”</p>
